its most important feature as a utilitarian agricultural structure, is largely intact. The barn clearly is a representative example of its type and of traditional braced-frame construction and, in a local context as Brick Township rapidly losses the vestiges of its rural past to rapid suburban development, has significance as a rare surviving example. In the larger context of coastal New Jersey, the barn is an important example of the use of ship-building materials in non-marine construction. Authorities on the region's vernacular architecture and water craft have indicated that there appears to have been a tradition of such practices, but that examples are rare. A hotel (no longer extant) and a house in hat is now Island Beach State Park are said to have been constructed from ship timbers. An examination of pertinent historic site surveys and cultural resource assessments suggests that the Pettit Barn is the only known New Jersey example of this practice in the construction of agricultural buildings. On another level the Pettit Barn sheds light on the widespread tradition of the construction of house by shipwrights; it provides clear evidence not of shipwrights buildings houses, but of the use of ship-building materials in a non-marine context.

Constructed between 1921 and 1923, the building was sited in a prominent and highly visible location overlooking Military Park, around which were located many of the city's major retail stores, businesses and hotels. Reflective of the city's major regional and national important as a financial center, the Newark Athletic Club was seen by its over three thousand members as the social and cultural centerpiece within their professional lives. The club's numerous lounges areas, dining rooms, and meeting rooms, therefore, served the business and social needs of its members while its athletic facilities including a well-equipped gymnasium and an indoor swimming pool provided opportunities for relaxation and recreation. The club building also had about three hundred bedrooms. \nThe Newark Athletic Club is an excellent architectural example of the athletic club-form, a building type that was developed and refind during the first few decades of the 20th century, when numbers of such clubs were built. Stylistically, the building is solidly Classic Revival and an excellent example of the adaptation of Renaissance-inspired forms and Beaux Arts planning to 20th century needs. By 1943, owing to changes in Newark's economic and demographic profiles brought about, in part, by both the Depression and World War II, and the bankruptcy of the club, the building was converted into use as the Military Park Hotel, after which the building began its gradual decline. It was eventually abandoned and last occupied by numbers of street and homeless people.

He was of the Eagle (not Raven) Moiety.", "Significance: In 1878 the Presbyterian Home Mission Society established its first missions in southeast Alaska.  At the request of Fort Tongass and Cape Fox Tlingit, Dr. Sheldon Jackson offered to establish a school if the Tlingit congregated in a single village.  The relocation project did not materialize until 1895 when Congress made a special appropriation to help establish the new village.  Chief Kashakes, head chief of the Cape Fox Tlingit and a member of the Beaver Clan of the Eagle Moiety, participated in the selection of the new village site at Saxman 2.5 miles south of Ketchikan.  He announced that he would build his new clan house next door to the school.  Chief Kashakes also built four other homes for his family in Saxman.  Chief Kashakes Clan House was built in 1895 and exemplifies the transition from traditional single-room plank clan houses to balloon frame construction that occurred as the Tlingits moved into new communities in the late 1800s and pursued wage-paying positions.  The name of the carpenter is unknown, though he probably constructed the framing and the tongue and groove siding.  By the 1900s balloon frame construction flourished throughout the southeast in Haines, Juneau, Ketchikan, and Saxman.  Despite the change in construction technique, the clan house remained communally owned and open to all clan members.  The first floor was spacious to accommodate traditional Native activities similar to the design found in plank clan houses.  The second floor was later partitioned into sleeping areas.  Outside the house stand two totem poles, the marble base of a third, and one Russian cannon.  Chief Kashakes died in the 1912 pneumonia epidemic and was succeeded in the traditional Tlingit manner by two of his nephews.  Chief Kashakes House is one of the last remaining examples of balloon frame construction in southeast Alaska.  It is central to the historic village of Saxman, the original school, and the surrounding Cape Fox and Fort Tongass totem pole collection, and the Beaver Clan tribal house.
